From the *Pirates of the Caribbean* movies to the *Harry Potter* series, Americans are used to seeing adventure movies top the charts. In fact, 14 out of 20 of the highest grossing movies in the past 20 years has been an adventure film. Audiences are captivated again and again by their dramatic scenes and increasingly realistic graphics. 

Due to the success it has seen in recent years, one would expect to see growth in this genre each year, but the data tells another story. The number of adventure movies being produced has been increasing over the past few decades, peaking in 2015, with over 450 adventure movies produced. In just the past couple years, however, the adventure genre has seen a dip in the number of movies produced, leading some to question whether this marks the beginning of the end of the popularity of adventure movies. 

Even toward the beginning of the decade people were wondering if the bubble of adventure movies was going to burst. Caleb Bressler, writer with *The Snapper*, raised these questions in the early 2010s. Of the action and adventure movie genres he wrote, “With this new decade, it will be interesting to see where the film industry will go. ...whether or not [action and adventure movies will] remain popular is yet to be seen. They may be overtaken by other genres.”

Being a few years into the future, we can see that these fears have not yet been realized. Adventure movies are some of the most popular movies, evidenced by their box office revenue and ticket sales. This graph provided by Stony Brook University shows the average gross in USD of the 20 most popular genres between 2011 and 2014. Adventure movies are number 1 at over 90 million dollars, closely followed by animated movies and fantasy movies, both of which are also often categorized as adventure movies. In the years spanning 1995 to the present, adventure movies alone make up for [almost 30% of all ticket sales](https://www.statista.com/statistics/188658/movie-genres-in-north-america-by-box-office-revenue-since-1995/). 

One reason so many adventure films have been made in recent decades is the fact that audiences love them. Andrew Davis, director of *Holes* (2003), *The Fugitive* (1993), and a number of other action and adventure movies, said, “"People want to see action. Life is boring for a lot of people and they want to be excited."

Another contributing factor to the sheer amount of adventure movies being made is the fact that so many subgenres and offshoots are made, most of which get categorized under the umbrella term “adventure,”  multiplying the genre manyfold. Subgenres of adventure movies include pirate films, disaster films, and the very popular subgenre of superhero films. There’s also often a lot of overlap with other genres, such as action, fantasy, or science fiction.

Even if this downward trend continued for a while, the chances of it climbing back up in a few years is high. Throughout their history, the number of adventure movies produced each year has fluctuated: some dips in the genre have been more drastic than others. In 1966, the number of adventure movies produced plummeted, and in just 6 years’ time the number had fallen by almost 60%. Movies of most genres saw a drop in production due to the age of New Hollywood, changing demographics and the rise of television’s popularity lead to a movie crisis. Luckily for the actors, movie producers and directors involved, that wasn’t the end of movies, nor was it even the end of adventure movies. The number of adventure movies produced began to climb once again. By about 1987, the number had gotten up to just over 70% of what it once had been, and in 1993, the movie genre saw the then-record year for number of adventure movies produced.

Though it did take a while for the genre to work its way up to producing that many movies once again in this case, most of the fluctuation we see in the data is on a smaller, year-to-year basis. For instance, in 1776, the number dropped by about 20% from the year before, but by the very next year, the number had gone up again, and even more movies were produced than were produced in 1775. Since we can see that the bigger trend over the past 20 years is an increase in the number of adventure movies produced, we think it is safe to assume that the past couple years are simply a small set back in the context of this larger trend, and that the genre will continue to grow in the near future. That being said, recent years have seen a few changes that could have had or could still have some effect on the genre. 

One change is the increase of online streaming. Companies like Netflix and Hulu have seen huge growth, and could be damaging the movie business by drawing viewers out of theaters and into their homes. On top of that, more and more of the popular content on websites like these is no longer the traditional movie, but it instead a TV show or series. If these are the reasons we have seen this dent in adventure movies, there’s a chance that the genre, along with other movie genres, will never recover.

Additionally, the increase in popularity of other genres could have an impact on adventure movies as well. Many genres have seen growth, the most notable being the documentary. Documentaries are quite ideal for film studios because they make such a large profit. Since documentaries don’t need costly actors or pricey special effects, their production costs are relatively low; the typical budget for a successful documentary is 1 million dollars. In comparison, the movie that currently holds the title for most expensive movie ever produced is an adventure movie: *Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides*, with a total budget of a staggering 378.5 million dollars. 

If a documentary does quite well it can return a gross of almost 70 times its production cost, making it incredibly profitable. Most adventure movies return a profit, but because production costs are so high, the percentage of the production costs they get back is lower. That being said, since adventure movies are typically dealing with higher amounts of money for both production costs and profits, they make much more on average. In the world of movie making, reeling in a large profit is essential to one’s career. Davis said, “It's all about money. Isn't it wonderful? Great movie makers come through Hollywood all the time but if you don't make money on your movies...forget it.” There is a high amount of pressure on film studios and directors to create movies that will do well in office. Because adventure movies tend  to do so well, we are inclined to think that as long as adventure movies are able to continue bringing in this much money the genre will continue to thrive. 

Going forward, the future of movies of all genres is a bit uncertain, but as far was we can tell, the end of movies, especially the end of adventure movies, won’t be anytime soon.
