From the *Pirates of the Caribbean* movies to the *Harry Potter* film series, Americans are used to seeing adventure movies top the charts. In fact, 14 out of 20 of the highest grossing movies in the past 20 years has been an adventure film. We are captivated by their dramatic fighting and ever so real graphics. As a result, we would not think of adventure movies being anywhere else but the top.

In the past five years, the amount of adventure movies that have been produced have been decreasing. Though as a society, adventure movies have been rated highly by critics and by the audience. As a result, people question in the future where the popularity and production of adventure movies will stand. However, they should not as the continue gross, the consistency of the trend, and the popularity keeps the genre alive.

Adventure movies are among the most popular movies, especially in the box office in terms of revenue, alongside comedy movies and action movies.[^1] Subgenres of adventure movies include pirate films, disaster films, and the very popular subgenre of superhero films. It's also a genre that is easily combined with others, such as action, fantasy, or science fiction films. The ticket shares reflect this popularity because in a period from 1995 to 2017, they have had a share of 27.7% of all ticket sales.[^1] In an interactive graph provided by Stony Brook University, this shows the gross rate for different genre of movies between 2011 and 2014. As a result, adventure movies are on top exemplifying its popularity with their audience. People are willing to go see an adventure movie when there are released. They rather go see an adventure movie rather than any other genre based on the gross of each genre. Thus increasing the ticket sales of the adventure genre. Therefore the relationship between the number of movies produced and the grossing rate does not influence the popularity of adventure movies.

Though there is an apparent decrease in adventure movies in the past five years, we might just be living in this blip. Based on history we have experienced this before. For example there was a big increase during the 1950s and the 1990s to early 2000s.This first increase could be the cause of a new emerging genre. Many moviegoers figured out the existence of adventure movies and were captivated by them. Thus, this encouraged the movie directors to create more movies. However, during the 1960’s, Hollywood was going through a renovation. Companies were buying out movie corporations.  This lead into a decrease in adventure movies being produced. Since money was being shifted around, there was not enough money to produce a well adventure movie for the customers to see. As a result, since the corporations did not have sufficient amount of money, directors had to shift the genre of movie they were making to accommodate the budget they had.

Keeping this in mind, this ongoing increasing and decreasing trend does not matter in the long run. It is seen generation after generation people do enjoy watching adventure movies. They create a sense of escape as they can feel like the heroine fighting through injustices of the world. Many directors over the years know that adventure movies are a popular genre for people to see. People would rather watch an adventure over other genre movies because of the captivating plot and characters. As a result, directors are willing to continue making different types of adventure movies because people are willing to come back to theme. This concept is shown in the graph as every time the number of movies decreases, after a couple of years, the movies produced always goes back up with a higher increasing rate. 
</br>However, as opposed to adventure films, documentaries are highly profitable and on the rise. A considerable amount of money is made in return, people really dig documentaries. This doesn't necessarily tell the whole story, however, since documentaries typically work on significantly lower budgets than adventure movies—the typical budget for a documentary is $1 million. This contrasts with the significantly higher budgets for adventure movies (especially successful ones) as those tend to rely more on their stars, and thus will have higher budgets.

</br>
The movie that currently holds the title for most expensive movie ever produced is an adventure movie, *Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides*, with a total budget of a staggering $378.5 million dollars. This range of how much making an adventure movie vs. making a documentary can contribute to ultimately the quantity of the movies made. Money is an issue when it comes to producing movies. If directors do not have the right budget, the movie is not going to be made period.  This factor illustrates the continuous rise of documentaries produced in the past five years. Therefore, this might depict that the production of adventure movies continue to decrease over the next few people. Though these graphs don’t control for genre multiplicity, it might add to the reason why comedy movies are significantly more produced. In any case, this concept could be the cause of people losing interest in adventure movies and moving to a different genre. In addition to the widespread technological advances that stray away from movies, including streaming companies like Amazon Prime and Netflix. These factors could move directors into another direction as they hesitate to make adventure movies in the future.

There is no doubt that we are currently living in an age of decreasing adventure movies. However, adventure buffs should not worry as they will go up in the near future. Sales tickets of in adventure movies are still high. With that said, people are willing to go see adventure movies. Though they do take a hefty amount of money to make, it is all worth it from the ticket sales. Therefore, this big revenue of money drives the directors to make more of these movies. So if you’re worried that adventure movies fading out, do not be because they will be back and better than ever.
