From the Pirates of the Caribbean movies to the Harry Potter film series, Americans are used to seeing adventure movies top the charts. In fact, 14 out of 20 of the highest grossing movies in the past 20 years has been an adventure film. We are captivated by their dramatic fighting and ever so real graphics. But what if this isn’t what people want in the future? There has to be a time where these movie plots get old and people are not interested in them anymore; maybe that time is sooner than we think.

Adventure movies are among the most popular movies, especially in the box office in terms of revenue, alongside comedy movies and action movies.<sup>2</sup> Subgenres of adventure movies include pirate films, disaster films, and the very popular subgenre of superhero films. It's also a genre that is easily combined with others, such as action, fantasy, or science fiction films. The ticket shares reflect this popularity because in a period from 1995 to 2017, they have had a share of 27.7% of all ticket sales.<sup>2</sup> In an interactive graph provided by www.the-numbers.com (http://www.the-numbers.com/live/cont/market/items_all_market_share_graph_iframe.php?movie_od_name_term=genre&cache_annual_postfix=genres&max_items=7&graph_category_text_plural=Genres), a pattern of ticket sales is similar to the number of adventure movies produced per year. This of course could correlate with the fact there are less movies to buy tickets for, or perhaps previous years' box office rates affect what will be produced later. However, this might be the case the production of adventure movies have declined within the past years. Factors such as large budgets, and technological advances contribute to this trend. 
Looking at the overall graph, there is no doubt that the productions of overall movies produced have risen over the past generations. However there is an ongoing increasing and decreasing trend between adventure movies. For example there was a big increase during the 1950s and the 1990s to early 2000s.This first increase could be the cause of a new emerging genre. Many moviegoers figured out the existence of adventure movies and were captivated by them. Thus, this encouraged the movie directors to create more movies. However, during the 1960’s, Hollywood was going through a renovation. Companies were buying out movie corporations.  This lead into a decrease in adventure movies being produced. Since money was being shifted around, there was not enough money to produce a well adventure movie for the customers to see. As a result, since the corporations did not have sufficient amount of money, directors had to shift the genre of movie they were making to accommodate the budget they had. 
As for the increase in the 1990’s, many Disney movies were created and then in the 2000s many marvel and dc comics’ movies were made increasing the production of adventure movies. These types of movies caught on a lot of popularity with children and adults. For example, Toy Story was a big hit with children and Jurassic Park was a blockbuster for the teens and young adults. As result, many directors were encouraged to create more of these movies to appeal to audiences.  However recently, less adventure movies were produced in 2016 as opposed to 2015—the movies from 2016 include Justice League, Thor: Ragnarok, and Wonder Woman, all of which performed well and come with a lot of hype. On the other hand, movies produced in 2015 included Suicide Squad, Batman vs Superman, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and Deadpool, all of which came with a lot of hype—these movies had a fair amount of criticism, but they all did excellently at the box office, both domestically and globally. This shift from 2015 to 2016 depicts the consistency of the quality but also showcases that the number of these adventure more have decreased. This change could be the cause of people losing interest in adventure movies and moving to a different genre. In addition to the widespread technological advances that stray away from movies, including streaming companies like Amazon Prime and Netflix. These factors could move directors into another direction as they hesitate to make movies in the future.

</br>However, as opposed to adventure films, documentaries are highly profitable and on the rise. Though a considerable amount of money is made in return, people really dig documentaries. This doesn't necessarily tell the whole story, however, since documentaries typically work on significantly lower budgets than adventure movies—the typical budget for a documentary is $1 million.<sup>4</sup>. This contrasts with the significantly higher budgets for adventure movies (especially successful ones) as those tend to rely more on their stars, and thus will have higher budgets. The movie that currently holds the title for most expensive movie ever produced is an adventure movie, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, with a total budget of a staggering $378.5 million dollars. This range of how much making an adventure movie vs. making a documentary can contribute to ultimately the quantity of the movies made. Money is an issue when it comes to producing movies. If directors do not have the right budget, the movie is not going to be made period.  This factor illustrates the continuous rise of documentaries produced in the past five years.

</br>It is clear that the popularity of adventure movies goes through different generations. Sometimes it is a hit like in the 1950’s and 90’s and other times it is not. Therefore, directors produce movies in other genres like comedy. Though the sales tickets of adventure movies are still high, we may be living in a fad. The steady decease of production in adventure movies depict that they are becoming less popular to make. With that said, it may lose its popularity until the next generation. So adventure buffs, go see your adventure movies now because they might not be as readily available in the future.
